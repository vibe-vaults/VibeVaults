/**
 * Main Responsibility: Public privacy policy. Doubles as the GDPR Article 13/14
 * information notice, so it has to name the controller in a legally
 * identifiable way and list every category of data the product actually
 * touches.
 *
 * Sensitive Dependencies:
 * - `OPERATOR` in `@/lib/legal-entity` is the controller identity under GDPR
 *   Art. 13(1)(a), shared with the terms of service. For a
 *   Hungarian sole trader ("egyéni vállalkozó") a bare personal name is not
 *   enough: the registration number, tax number, and registered seat are what
 *   make the controller identifiable. Blank values are omitted from the render,
 *   so an unfilled field silently degrades rather than shipping "TODO" to
 *   production, but it is still a compliance gap until filled.
 * - Section 3.2 mirrors what `public/widget.js` (`getMetadata`) actually
 *   captures and what `/docs/widget-data` tells customers. If the widget starts
 *   or stops collecting something, all three have to move together.
 * - Section 7 is the sub-processor list. Adding a vendor that touches personal
 *   data means adding it here.

                    <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-gray-800">3.2 End Users (Feedback Widget)</h3>
                    <p className="mb-4">
                        The widget is invite-only or opened through a review link. It shows nothing to an anonymous visitor. When feedback is submitted through a widget, the following is collected and shown to the customer who owns the widget:
                    </p>
                    <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
                        <li>The feedback content submitted voluntarily, and any replies in the resulting conversation</li>
                        <li>Email address, and for review links a self-declared name, used to attribute the feedback and to send replies</li>
                        <li>Any files or screenshots the reporter chooses to attach</li>
                        <li>The address of the page the feedback was written on, and the position of the pin on that page together with a CSS selector for the element it was anchored to</li>
                        <li>Browser context: user agent string, screen and viewport size, and browser language</li>
                        <li>The last 50 browser console messages produced by the customer&apos;s own site while the reporter was on the page</li>
                        <li>Up to 15 failed network requests from the customer&apos;s own site, recorded as method, address, and outcome</li>
                        <li>Technical metadata such as IP address (for rate limiting and abuse prevention)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p className="mb-4">
                        <strong>Query strings are removed before a page address is recorded.</strong> Only the origin and path are stored, because host site query strings routinely carry reset tokens, access tokens, and email addresses. Email-shaped path segments are replaced with a redaction marker. This stripping happens in the browser, before the entry is created, so the discarded part never reaches us. The full detail is published at{" "}

                    <p className="mb-4">
                        We also receive two operational signals from the widget that are not shown to customers and are used only to keep the widget working: crash reports raised by the widget&apos;s own code, and screenshot capture diagnostics (browser, graphics renderer, device pixel ratio, viewport, duration) used to measure a known browser rendering bug.
                    </p>
                    <p className="mb-6">
                        We do not require end users to create accounts, and the widget does not track end users across sites.

                        <li><strong>Where we got it:</strong> your company&apos;s website and public LinkedIn profile, and Apollo, a business contact database. We did not get it from you</li>
                        <li><strong>Why:</strong> to introduce a product relevant to your professional role. Legal basis is our legitimate interest in direct business-to-business marketing, Art. 6(1)(f)</li>
                        <li><strong>Business contact data only.</strong> We do not collect personal addresses, personal phone numbers, or anything about your private life</li>

                    <p className="mb-6">
                        If you book a setup call, we receive your name, email address, the time you picked, and anything you write in the booking form. Bookings are handled by Calendly and the call itself takes place on Zoom. We do not record these calls. We use this only to hold the call and follow up on it. Legal basis is taking steps at your request before entering into a contract, Art. 6(1)(b).

                        The processor terms in our <Link href="/terms-of-service" className="underline">Terms of Service</Link>, together with this policy and the sub-processor list in section 7, form the data processing agreement between us and our customers. We engage the sub-processors listed in section 7 and remain responsible for their performance. We will give customers notice of a new sub-processor before it starts processing their data, so they have an opportunity to object.

                    <p className="mb-4">
                        Data is stored on secure servers provided by our infrastructure partners. We keep personal data only as long as it is needed for the purpose it was collected for:
                    </p>
                    <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
                        <li><strong>Account data</strong> is kept while the account exists, and deleted when you delete the account.</li>
                        <li><strong>Feedback and conversation data</strong> is kept until the customer deletes it or deletes the project it belongs to. Customers can delete it at any time from the dashboard.</li>
                        <li><strong>Accounting and invoicing records</strong> are kept for 8 years, as required by Hungarian accounting law. This retention overrides a deletion request for those specific records.</li>
                        <li><strong>IP addresses</strong> collected for rate limiting and abuse prevention are retained for up to 30 days, then purged or anonymized.</li>
                        <li><strong>Widget access tokens</strong> that are never used are deleted automatically 30 days after they are issued.</li>
                        <li><strong>Analytics data</strong> is retained for 1 year.</li>
                        <li><strong>Prospect contact data</strong> is deleted on objection, and contacts who never engaged are removed periodically. An opt-out record is kept indefinitely, because that is what stops us contacting you again.</li>
                        <li><strong>Setup call bookings</strong> are kept in our scheduling tool for as long as it holds them, so that we can follow up after the call.</li>
                        <li><strong>Support correspondence</strong> is kept for as long as the mailbox holds it, so that we can pick up an old thread if you write again.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p className="mb-6">
                        When we act as a processor, we delete or return customer feedback data on the customer&apos;s instruction, and after the end of the contract, subject to the legal retention above.

                        We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect personal data, including encryption in transit, row-level access control in the database, scoped access tokens for the widget, and restricted administrative access.
