/**
 * Main Responsibility: Public terms of service. Also carries the Ekertv. 4. §
 * service provider disclosure and the Article 28 processor terms that the
 * privacy policy points at when it calls this document half of the data
 * processing agreement.
 *
 * Sensitive Dependencies:
 * - `OPERATOR` in `@/lib/legal-entity` is shared with the privacy policy. Both
 *   pages must name the same entity with the same registration numbers.
 * - Section 8 is referenced by /privacy-policy section 4. If the processor
 *   terms move or are removed, that reference breaks and the DPA claim in the
 *   privacy policy stops being true.
 * - Section 9 states the trial length and that no card is required. That mirrors
 *   the trial clock in `20260417000000_trial_starts_on_workspace_creation.sql`
 *   (14 days, starting at first owned workspace) and the comparison pages in
 *   `@/lib/compare-data`.

                    <p className="mb-4">We may update these Terms from time to time.</p>
                    <p className="mb-6">
                        Updated versions will be posted on our website with a revised &#8220;Last updated&#8221; date. Where a change materially affects your rights or obligations, we will notify account holders by email at least 30 days before it takes effect. Continued use of the Service after that date means you accept the updated Terms; if you do not, you may cancel before they take effect.

                    <p className="mb-4">
                        These Terms are governed by the laws of <strong>Hungary</strong>, without regard to conflict of law principles and excluding the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods.
                    </p>
                    <p className="mb-6">
                        The courts of Hungary have jurisdiction over any dispute arising out of or in connection with these Terms. If you are a consumer, this does not deprive you of the protection of the mandatory law of the country where you live, or of your right to bring proceedings there. We ask that you contact us first at {OPERATOR.email} so we can try to resolve the matter directly.

                        <li><strong>Severability.</strong> If any provision of these Terms is found unenforceable, the rest remains in force and the unenforceable provision is replaced by one that comes closest to its intended effect.</li>
                        <li><strong>No waiver.</strong> Not enforcing a provision is not a waiver of the right to enforce it later.</li>
                        <li><strong>Assignment.</strong> You may not assign these Terms without our written consent. We may assign them in connection with a transfer of the business, on notice to you.</li>
                        <li><strong>Entire agreement.</strong> These Terms and the Privacy Policy are the entire agreement between us regarding the Service and replace any earlier understandings.</li>
