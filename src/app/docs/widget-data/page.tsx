            <div className="docs-prose">
                <h2 id="what-travels">What travels with a report</h2>
                <p>Every feedback submission carries:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Page URL</strong> — the address of the page the feedback was written on</li>
                    <li><strong>Browser and operating system</strong>, derived from the user agent string</li>
                    <li><strong>Screen and viewport size</strong>, and the browser language</li>
                    <li><strong>Console logs</strong> — the last 50 entries</li>
                    <li><strong>Failed requests</strong> — up to 15 entries</li>
                    <li><strong>The pin</strong> — where on the page the feedback was placed, and the element it was anchored to</li>
                    <li><strong>A screenshot and any files</strong> the reporter chose to attach</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    All of it is visible to you in the dashboard on the feedback detail view. Nothing is hidden from the account
                    that receives the report.
                </p>

                <h2 id="pin-position">The pin</h2>
                <p>
                    Feedback written in the widget is attached to a point on the page, so each report also carries the
                    information needed to put that pin back where it belongs. That is:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>a CSS selector for the element the pin was placed on or beside, such as <code>#pricing-cta</code></li>
                    <li>the pin&apos;s position relative to that element, as an offset or a percentage</li>
                    <li>the page address, without its query string</li>
                    <li>the viewport width and pixel ratio the feedback was written at</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    This is structural information about your own markup, not anything about the person reporting. The selector
                    is built from ids and test attributes you already wrote, or from the shape of the document. No text content
                    is read out of the element.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The page address recorded for a pin is stripped to the origin and path, for the same reason described{" "}
                    <a href="#query-strings">below</a>. A pin on <code>/orders?customer=jane@example.com</code> is stored
                    against <code>/orders</code>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A reply pinned inside a conversation records only these two things, the anchor and the page path, plus
                    its screenshot. Replies never carry the console or failed-request buffers described next; those travel
                    with the original report alone.
                </p>

                <h2 id="console-logs">Console logs</h2>
                <p>
                    The widget keeps a rolling buffer of the last 50 <code>console.log</code>, <code>console.warn</code>, and{" "}
                    <code>console.error</code> calls made on the page and attaches it to the report. Entries are recorded as
                    your site produced them, so whatever your own code chooses to log is what appears.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Worth knowing: if your application logs request payloads, user records, or tokens to the console, those end
                    up in the buffer. That is your logging decision, not something the widget adds. If it matters for your site,
                    keep sensitive values out of the console.
                </p>

                <h2 id="failed-requests">Failed requests</h2>
                <p>
                    Network failures never reach the console. When a request returns a 500 or is blocked, the browser writes
                    that straight into its developer tools, and no JavaScript on the page can see it as a log line. Since a
                    failed request is the most common cause of “I clicked the button and nothing happened”, the widget watches
                    for them directly and records them alongside the console entries, tagged{" "}
                    <strong className="text-violet-600">network</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>An entry looks like this:</p>
                <pre><code>POST https://yoursite.com/api/checkout failed: 500 Internal Server Error</code></pre>
                <p>That is the whole entry. It records:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>the HTTP method</li>
                    <li>the origin and path of the request, with no query string</li>
                    <li>the status code, or the reason it never completed, such as a network error or a timeout</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Only failures are recorded. Successful requests are ignored entirely. Repeated identical failures are
                    collapsed into one entry, so a retrying request cannot flood the report.
                </p>

                <h2 id="query-strings">Why query strings are stripped</h2>
                <p>This is deliberate, and it is the one place where we knowingly give up diagnostic detail.</p>
                <p>
                    Query strings routinely carry secrets. A password reset that fails would put its reset token in the report.
                    A call to <code>?access_token=…</code> would put a live credential in it. A lookup like{" "}
                    <code>?email=jane@example.com</code> would put one of your users&apos; personal data into a bug report they
                    never knew was being written.
                </p>
                <p>
                    None of that belongs in our database. So the widget removes the query string before the entry is created,
                    on the user&apos;s device, before anything is sent. The values never leave the browser and we never receive
                    them. Path segments that look like email addresses are replaced with <code>[redacted]</code> for the same
                    reason, and very long segments are truncated.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The practical consequence: you can see <em>which endpoint</em> failed and <em>how</em> it failed, but not
                    the parameters of that one call. In our experience the endpoint and status are what you need to reproduce a
                    bug, and the parameters are what you would have to explain to a data protection officer.
                </p>

                <h2 id="never-recorded">What is never recorded</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Query strings</strong> on failed requests, as described above</li>
                    <li><strong>Request and response bodies</strong> — the widget reads neither</li>
                    <li><strong>HTTP headers, cookies, and authorization tokens</strong> from your site&apos;s requests</li>
                    <li><strong>Successful requests</strong> — no general traffic log is built</li>
                    <li><strong>Keystrokes, form contents, or session replay</strong> — the widget does not record the session</li>
                    <li><strong>The widget&apos;s own calls</strong> to VibeVaults, filtered out so our traffic never clutters your reports</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 id="ai-agents">If you connect an AI tool</h2>
                <p>
                    Everything described on this page is visible to an AI tool that you connect to your account, including the pin,
                    the browser details, the console logs, and the failed requests. It reads them as you, only for the workspaces
                    you allow, and the content is sent on to that tool&apos;s provider at your instruction. Because query strings
                    are removed in the browser, they are not among it. See <Link href="/docs/ai-agents">AI agents (MCP)</Link> for
                    what a connection can do and how to limit it.

                <p>
                    The widget only appears for people you have invited, and it collects this context at the moment someone
                    chooses to send you feedback. Even so, under the GDPR you are the data controller for your users&apos; data
                    and VibeVaults is your processor. If you operate in the EU, your own privacy notice should mention that
                    submitting feedback shares page context and console output with a third-party provider.
