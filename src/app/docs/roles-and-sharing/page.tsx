/**
 * Main Responsibility: Explains the workspace/project hierarchy, the three
 * roles (owner, member, client, guest), plan limits, and public share boards.
 *
 * Sensitive Dependencies:
 * - Plan names, prices and limits are READ from `src/lib/tier-config.ts`
 *   (TIER_DISPLAY + TIER_LIMITS), never restated here, so a pricing change
 *   cannot leave this page lying. Only the prose framing is hand-written.
 * - Public boards are tier-gated; keep in step with `toggleProjectSharing()`.

                <p>
                    A <strong>workspace</strong> holds people. A <strong>project</strong> holds one website and its feedback.
                    Projects belong to a workspace, and anyone in the workspace can work on any of its projects.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The arrangement most agencies land on is one workspace per client, with a project for each site or
                    environment you are reviewing. If you are a freelancer with a handful of sites, a single workspace with
                    several projects is simpler and works fine.
                </p>

                <h2 id="roles">The four roles</h2>
                <h3>Owner</h3>
                <p>
                    The person who created the workspace. Owners do everything members can do, plus invite and remove people,
                    manage the subscription, and turn public boards on or off. Plan limits are counted against the owner&apos;s
                    account.
                </p>
                <h3>Member</h3>
                <p>
                    Your team. Members sign in to the dashboard, see every project in the workspace, reply to feedback, change
                    status, create projects, and delete them. They cannot manage billing or invite people.
                </p>
                <h3>Client</h3>
                <p>
                    The people reviewing the website, invited by email from your dashboard. Clients only ever see the widget
                    on the site itself. They have no account, no password, and no dashboard access, and they cannot see who
                    else was invited. Clients are unlimited on every plan and never affect your bill.
                </p>
                <h3>Guest</h3>
                <p>
                    Anyone who opens your project&apos;s shareable review link and enters a name and email. Guests get the
                    same widget experience as clients — pinning, threads, reply notifications — but you never invited them
                    individually, so their email is self-declared and access is managed for the whole group at once: pause
                    review feedback and every guest is paused, while clients and members are unaffected. Guests are also
                    unlimited and free.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The practical difference: invite someone as a <strong>client</strong> when you have an ongoing
                    relationship and may want to revoke exactly that person later; hand out the <strong>guest</strong> review
                    link when you want a whole stakeholder group commenting five minutes from now.
                </p>

                    <p>
                        A client or guest is not a lesser dashboard user, it is a different thing entirely. If you want
                        someone to see the dashboard, invite them as a member instead. How each kind gets access to the
                        widget is covered in <Link href="/docs/widget-access">How widget access works</Link>.

                <h2 id="limits">What each plan allows</h2>
                <p>
                    Limits are counted across your whole account, not per workspace, so ten projects means ten projects in
                    total. Team member counts include you and exclude clients.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    {TIER_DISPLAY.map((tier) => {
                        const limits = TIER_LIMITS[tier.slug];
                        const extras = [
                            limits.showBranding ? "shows a small VibeVaults badge on the widget" : "no badge on the widget",
                            limits.publicDashboard ? "public boards available" : null,
                            limits.prioritySupport ? "priority support" : null,
                        ].filter(Boolean);
                        const extraText = extras.join(", ");
                        return (
                            <li key={tier.slug}>
                                <strong>
                                    {tier.name}, ${tier.monthlyPrice}/month
                                </strong>{" "}
                                — {planLine(tier.slug)}. {extraText.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + extraText.slice(1)}
                                {"."}

                </ul>
                <p>
                    Yearly billing saves {Math.round(YEARLY_DISCOUNT * 100)}% on all {TIER_DISPLAY.length} plans. Every plan
                    starts with a 14-day trial, and there are no per-client or per-feedback fees on any of them. Current
                    pricing always lives on the <Link href="/pricing">pricing page</Link>.
                </p>

                <h2 id="share-boards">Public feedback boards</h2>
                <p>
                    A project can publish a read-only board at a private link. Anyone with the link sees the feedback items and
                    their statuses without signing in and without being able to change anything.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is for the people who want visibility but should not be in the loop: a client&apos;s manager, a
                    stakeholder who only wants to watch progress, or your own status page during a launch week. Turn it on from
                    the project&apos;s <strong>Share</strong> card, and turn it off whenever you like. Regenerating the link
                    immediately invalidates the old one.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Treat the link as semi-public. It is unguessable, but anyone it is forwarded to can read the board, so do
                    not enable it on a project whose feedback discusses anything confidential. Public boards are available on{" "}
                    {TIER_DISPLAY.filter((t) => TIER_LIMITS[t.slug].publicDashboard).map((t) => t.name).join(" and ")}.
                </p>

                <h2 id="leaving">People leaving</h2>
                <p>
                    Members can leave a workspace themselves, and owners can remove them. Either way the owner is notified, and
                    the person&apos;s widget access for that workspace&apos;s projects is revoked at the same moment. Their
                    feedback and replies stay where they are, so the history of a project does not develop holes when someone
                    moves on.
