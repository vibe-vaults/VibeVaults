/**
 * Main Responsibility: Single source of truth for the /docs section — the page
 * list, their titles, summaries, and order. Drives the docs index, the sidebar
 * nav, the site footer's Docs column, and the sitemap, so adding a page here is
 * the only step needed for it to appear everywhere.
 *
 * Sensitive Dependencies:
 * - Each `slug` must match a directory under `src/app/docs/`. There is no
 *   runtime check; a mismatch ships a 404 link into the nav and the sitemap.
 * - `src/app/sitemap.ts` maps over this list.
