            question: "Is VibeVaults a good Usersnap alternative?",
            answer: "Yes, if you want a real-time, invite-only feedback conversation on the live site with console logs on every plan and less to configure. Usersnap is the stronger choice if you need a public upvote board, micro-surveys, or 50+ integrations for a product or QA team.",
        },
        {
            question: "Do my clients need an account or a browser extension?",
            answer: "No. Clients click a single invite link, once per device, and the widget appears on the site. They never create an account or install an extension, and uninvited visitors see nothing because VibeVaults is invite-only by design.",
        },
        {
            question: "Does VibeVaults or Usersnap have a free tier?",
            answer: "Neither has a permanent free tier. VibeVaults offers a 14-day free trial with no credit card and with no limitations. Usersnap offers a free trial that ends after 20 feedback items and deactivates the account after 90 days if you do not upgrade.",
        },
        {
            question: "Does VibeVaults capture console logs?",
            answer: "Yes, on every plan, alongside the screenshot and browser context. Usersnap captures console logs only on its Professional plan and above.",
        },
        {
            question: "Can I try VibeVaults for free?",
            answer: "Yes. Every plan starts with a 14-day free trial and no credit card required, and you can have the widget live on a real project in about 30 seconds.",
        },
